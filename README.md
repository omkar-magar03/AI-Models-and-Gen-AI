## üëã Introduction

Welcome! This repository serves as my personal portfolio for various projects in the field of Artificial Intelligence. It features a range of applications, including deep learning for image classification, fine-tuning language models for specific tasks, and building interactive AI applications with modern tools like LangChain, LangGraph and Streamlit.

Each project is self-contained within its own directory and primarily developed using Jupyter Notebooks.
